            <h1>Imagine</h1>
            <h4>by John Lennon</h4>
            <p>Imagine there's no heaven <br>
                It's easy if you try <br>
                No hell below us <br>
                Above us, only sky</p>
            <p>Imagine all the people <br>
                Livin' for today <br>
                Ah</p>
            <p>Imagine there's no countries <br>
                It isn't hard to do <br>
                Nothing to kill or die for <br>
                And no religion, too</p>
            <p>Imagine all the people <br>
                Livin' life in peace <br>
                You</p>
            <p>You may say I'm a dreamer <br>
                But I'm not the only one <br>
                I hope someday you'll join us <br>
                And the world will be as one</p>
            <p>Imagine no possessions <br>
                I wonder if you can <br>
                No need for greed or hunger <br>
                A brotherhood of man</p>
            <p>Imagine all the people <br>
                Sharing all the world <br>
                You</p>
            <p>You may say I'm a dreamer <br>
                But I'm not the only one <br>
                I hope someday you'll join us <br>
                And the world will live as one</p>
